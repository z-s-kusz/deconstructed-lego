### About

First, this site was made so I could try out Nuxt and static site generation.
I decided to use pictures I took of sorted lego piles as the main content for the site instead of making a programming blog that I would update twice and forget about.
I added small blurbs on each one because it felt a bit empty so I guess it is something of a blog now but at least it isn't another tech blog.

<br/>
<!-- nuxt content does not respect spaces creating breaks and this shit is way harder to target in both dev and prod with css than it should be sooo.... yeah the only way I can get acceptable spacing is by adding newline, br, newline -->

### But why the sorting?

I like legos. I find sorting them to be a pleasing zen activity.
I didn't start sorting them with the intent of photographing them or uploading them to a site.
I think I started doing this around 2018 and didn't photograph my 1st set til 2020ish - covid lockdown and such.

### Photography

I think I make this clear in several of the initially uploaded sets but I am no photographer.
I use my phone camera, don't set up for lighting and sometimes I miss my target.
Now that I have these here I guess there is a little pressure to do better so I will take more care with future sets but don't expect much.

### More Images (mostly the same ones though)

Images are hosted on flickr.
I decided to go with flickr since a lot of the lego community is there and they have a generous free 1000 uploads.
