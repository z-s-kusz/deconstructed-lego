I bought a couple of these sets for the clear and gold parts to use in [MFZ](https://mobileframezero.com/mfz/) builds and figured, why not do a flat lay first?

I thought it would be cool to try and get the square bricks into a circular arrangement so I set it up on my drum throne.
I didn’t quite achieve what I was going for but I’m sure I can with more pieces to fill out the form, so expect to see others like this in the future.

While getting the outline for the shape set up I forgot about the minifig, which I like to include in the flat lays, so I ended up doing a second pic with the minifig and the spares in one.
