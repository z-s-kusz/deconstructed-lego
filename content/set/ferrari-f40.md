I’ve wanted an F40 set since playing the Lego DLC in Forza Horizon that included the car.
A slightly different version came out in 2019 but I didn’t care for that one.
Finally I have all three cars from the game, the F40, the Mini Cooper and the Mclaren!

I used textured cardboard as a surface to try a new look and I won't be using that again.
Getting Lego pieces to lay exactly as I placed them wasn’t possible.
The imprecision from pieces sliding around the grooves almost made me not upload this build.
And as far as the photos go,
I’m not sure what happened with the white balance, my auto exposure must not have liked all the sunlight.
Anyway, let's not end on a downer note.
I thought it was cool that the box had a “Ferrari Official Product” sticker.
And I’m really excited to have a few spare Dairy Queen spoons that were used as side-mirrors.
You can see those at the top with the tires in Bag 4.
