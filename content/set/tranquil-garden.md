The set is a nice display piece, it’s a bit larger than I thought it would be.
The larger trees and a garden ornament are on smooth bases
so you can easily rearrange them or slot in your own garden decor.

I did a couple different things with the photos this time.
First I took a pic of the final build for the initial image.
I figure if someone wants to see the official box art they can find it pretty easily online
(in fact, you can see it on brickset.com by clicking the set name at the top left).
Second, I placed the in-progress set next to some of the flat lays.
I actually did that for all steps but a few of them had unusable photos.
One thing I’ve learned about getting better photos is just to take more -
I throw a lot out when I put these final pages together.
