A couple things came together here to make this a more unique flat lay.
First, I found the computer mat I used to use as a building surface.
Second, the amount of repeat bricks in this set is huge.
I wasn't sure using the mat would be a good idea
but I decided to embrace the natural shapes to fit the botanical theme and avoid a completely monotonous flat lay.
I did the first bag “traditionally” since it was an inorganic structure and I let loose with all the others.

I made this in the tail end of spring so I used the pink and white foliage in my first design.
Unfortunately this set marks the first time I got a new Lego set with a missing piece.
A full day later and many sweeps of the floor and bags didn't reveal the missing piece so I had to cannibalize a different set.

I don't want to overdo the mat background but expect to see it again at some point,
and definitely expect some more organic styled layouts going forward.
