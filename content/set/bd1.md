This build is awesome. I’m not sure what it is but something about making this one was a lot of fun.

I especially love bag 3 and bag 6.
The rounded pieces give a really nice fluid look that lego doesn’t often have, even in more modern builds, and my arrangement fit that well.
I only had 1 image of bag 6.
I like the side images but I’ll make sure to always get at least one top down going forward.
