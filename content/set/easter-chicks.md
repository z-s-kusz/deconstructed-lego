Looks like I'm missing a bag in my photos, only the egg pieces are shown here. Probably for the best,
it looks like I rushed the layout on an easter morning and had a subpar setup for the photo.

I don’t think I’ll be doing any more arrangements with so many 1x1 pieces
so don’t expect to see Revindell anytime soon.
