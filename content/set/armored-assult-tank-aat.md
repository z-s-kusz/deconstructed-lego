You can tell this is one of my newer builds from the neater arrangement.
I really like the symmetry on bag 3, it almost looks like a spaceship.

I built the minifigs for this one.
It goes against the deconstructed theme
but I think it looks cleaner and it's certainly easier to do arrangements with.
