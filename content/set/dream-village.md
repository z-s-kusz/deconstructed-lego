This is one of three of the Dreamzzz sets I got as soon as they became available.
I love to see what Lego does when creatively unrestricted with original set designs.

The other two sets are [Fantastical Tree House](https://brickset.com/sets/71461-1/Fantastical-Tree-House) and [Nightmare Shark Ship](https://brickset.com/sets/71469-1/Nightmare-Shark-Ship).
At a total of 2646 pieces between them, plus 434 for this set, doing flat lays for all three would go past fun and relaxing into monotonous sadness.
Nightmare shark is my favorite and Iâ€™m hoping to see more sets like these next year.
