Love the way these turned out.
As I look back at all the layouts I've done I'm noticing that I have a lot more fun
and I'm more accurate with more contained builds.
That likely comes from the way I build these by glancing at a bag
and having not much besides a general idea of the shape it will take - if there's less to look at it's easier to map it out in my head.
There would be less pieces slipping out of alignment, straining my patience, with smaller sets too.
If things are nudged or start to wander out it's easier to correct.
