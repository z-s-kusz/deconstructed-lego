Just like the stormtrooper mech, this was purchased for the minifig and to be cannibalized for parts.
I think this is the most modern Darth minifig I have by quite a few years.

This set, the stormtrooper mech, space land AND the haunted house sets were all completed sometime in 2023
but I only got around to publishing them now that Rivendell is finally off my back -
I just couldnâ€™t bring myself to add more sets with that one so close to being finished.
