I bought this set for all the pumpkins.
I didn’t build the full set, I made a custom tree and built the container mostly as-is to be a stand for minifigs.

I’m not sure why I’m having so much trouble with exposure on some of these photos.
I think it may have to do with my phone's HDR functionality so I will start setting my own focus and exposure for future shoots.
The yellow and red pieces look especially bad just like they did in the Ferrari set.
