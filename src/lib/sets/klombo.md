This is a promotional set sent out by Epic Games to streamers and influencers in the Fortnite space.
I’ve got an inside man that was able to get his hands on this set for me!
My data for sets on this blog requires a set ID which Lego has for all official sets.
Of course I never planned to upload an unofficial set.
It just goes to show how even the simplest assumption about data can be thrown off - so remember to check nulls and handle errors!
In this case I gave Klombo a special ID.

I went away from the instructions for the legs
(it’s an unofficial set, I can do what I want)!
His feet used grey that I thought took away from the aesthetic and the shape made him look more buglike than dinosaur-like.
I only had enough pieces to give him 4 legs that way but I like it better.
