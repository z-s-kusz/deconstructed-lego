I decided to get a medium/large set and try doing the whole thing as one flat lay.
I usually do many smaller arrangements per set because it's easier to keep organized and precise with less pieces.
But at this point I feel like I’ve pretty well explored what I’ve wanted to with smaller scale flat lay lego art.
This might be how I do most sets going forwards.
I have a bit more control over how it will take shape and I’m able to play with the colors more.
