Thanks to Eric for getting me this set!
This one is great for minifigs, according to BrickLink all five minifigs are unique to this set.
This is the first I have with the transparent/white lightsaber.

The stage has spinning bases for play.
Since I donâ€™t play with my sets like I did as a kid I deconstructed the stage and put the 4 monoliths (quadro-liths?) as stand alone builds around my desk with the minifigs.
