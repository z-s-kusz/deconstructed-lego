This is a peculiar set.
The connection between the nose section and the engine/wings uses some very clever tricks I haven't seen before. 
From certain angles it looks amazing and from others it looks like a puppy that hasn’t grown to fit his ears and paws yet.
Or maybe I’m just used to micro scale x-wing proportions.

This is my first flat lay since starting this site and really looking at the results of all my previous attempts.
The main difference (which I hope comes across) is improvements in precision piece laying and photography.
100% perfect spacing isn’t the goal but it is nice when it appears neat.
