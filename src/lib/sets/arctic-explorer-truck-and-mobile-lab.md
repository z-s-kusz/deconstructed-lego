This set has a lot of interesting pieces -
the minifigs have unique hats, hair and a fur collar!
The lab has a couple of unique joining pieces (seen in Bag 5)
and snow splatter tiles on the roof (best seen in the final build above).

The last couple of pictures are a bit crooked
because I did the flat lays and took the pictures with a cat on my lap -
they still turned out better than some of my oldest photos :).
I especially like the Bag 4 photos with the minifig holding the magnifying glass.

Side note: I still have yet to see a single lego set with any paper bags.
Lego has been mentioning them in the instruction booklets for what feels like at least 4 years
at this point, are they ever coming out?
